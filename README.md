NetBeans Meta Update Server
===========================

A simple standalone update server for [NetBeans](http://netbeans.org) and 
[NetBeans Platform application](http://platform.netbeans.org) plugins.  

Just run it using ``java -jar``. It will serve whatever plugins you tell it about, and
automatically check for updates.  Download it [from timboudreau.com](http://timboudreau.com/builds/job/meta-update-server/).

Your users can simply get updates using Tools | Plugins, with no additional
steps.

The server will generate and serve a plugin which registers it with Tools | Plugins
in NetBeans.  That's generated for you on startup and is always-up-to-date.


Features
--------

 * You give it URLs where your plugin (NBM) files live on the web.  
 * It downloads them and serves them.  
 * It processes metadata in the downloaded NBM files and uses that to figure out the rest.
 * It periodically checks for new versions and updates what it is serving automatically.
 * Automatically generates and serves a NetBeans plugin which registers your server as an update server - your users install that, and from then on the IDE/application will automatically check your server for updates
 * Logs hit and download statistics using in easily analyzed [bunyan-compatible JSON](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) using [bunyan-java](https://github.com/timboudreau/bunyan-java-v2)

Usage fairly self-explanatory - start it and navigate to it in a browser.  Try the [demo server](http://timboudreau.com/modules) to see what it does.

It serves NBM (NetBeans module) files with appropriate metadata so that the
NetBeans update center (Tools | Plugins) can download plugins from it.  It 
give you a way to distribute updates, where simply publishing a new version
at the same URL will make the new version automatically available to your users.


Use Case
--------

This was written to scratch an itch.  I have a [Jenkins](http://timboudreau.com/builds) 
continuous integration server which builds modules.  I want to publish them to users
so it is easy for them to get updates.  And I want no manual steps for me to provide them.

I briefly considered writing a Jenkins extension like its Maven Repository plugin,
which would serve this stuff. Then I thought, why be tied to Jenkins at all?  This solution
will serve whatever you want, wherever it is.

If you use this with Jenkins, one small change is useful to your Maven `pom.xml` - this
server relies on the download URLs for modules not changing, but by default Maven includes
the version in the NBM name.  To fix this, add `<finalName>YourModuleName</finalName>` to
the `configuration` section for **both** the `nbm-maven-plugin` and the `maven-jar-plugin`.

Usage
-----

Plugins are added to the server by adding remote URLs to NBM files via a web form on the home page the server serves.  The
primary use-case is wanting to distribute some modules built by a continuous
build.

Once a plugin is added, its URL is polled once per-hour to check for updates
(this will use the ``If-Modified-Since`` HTTP header to avoid excessive
downloading).  If an update is found, it is downloaded;  if its specification
verion is greater than an existing copy on the server, the old one is replaced.

The primary use-case is continuous builds - in fact, it came out of a discussion
of writing a Jenkins/Hudson plugin for this purpose.  This project accomplishes
the same thing in a simpler way.  So, this is an update server which serves ``nbm``
files which are available elsewhere via HTTP.  It has a small HTTP web api which
lets you add new NBMs.

The server uses [Acteur](http://github.com/timboudreau/acteur), an asynchronous
server framework based on [Netty](http://netty.io).  HTTP downloads from
remote servers are also asynchronous - meaning that this tiny web application can serve **a lot** of traffic while consuming minimal system resources.


Running The Server
------------------

Build it or download a binary.  Run it with ``java -jar``

If no directory path is passed to it, it will store and serve data from
``/tmp/nbmserver``

In a web browser, navigate to ``/`` to see a web page containing a list of
all modules served and an upload form. Uploading requires HTTP basic
authentication - for the password, either pass ``--password``
on the command line, or make a note of the generated password logged on
startup.


Web API / Adding NBMs
---------------------

The server has an extremely simple web API:

 * An HTTP GET to ``/modules`` lists the modules being served in XML, using the
NetBeans autoupdate DTD
   * Add ``?json=true`` to get this data in JSON format instead, if you want
to get this data in a usable form for client-side Javascript
 * An HTTP GET/PUT/POST to ``/add`` with the parameter ``url`` set to the
remote URL of an NBM file
   * This call requires HTTP Basic authentication
 * An HTTP GET to ``/download/$CODE_NAME/$HASH.nbm`` will download the cached
copy of an NBM file

There is one caveat:  If the URL to an NBM incorporates the version number of that
NBM, and an update will have a different version number, then you will need to manually
add the new URL every time you publish an update.  For automatic updates, 
change your build script not to do that.  HTTP does not do wild-cards, so 
there really is no other fix.


Configuring The Server
----------------------

All of the following properties can be set via the command-line by prefixing the 
property name with ``--`` - for example

    java -jar nbmserver-standalone.jar --port 3572 --external.port 80 --password hoohah

The system will also look for, and load if present, the following files:

 * /etc/nbmserver.properties
 * ~/nbmserver.properties
 * ./nbmserver.properties

any duplicates in the previous one being overridden in the next;  command-line
arguments override them all.

The following are useful properties

 * ``nbm.dir`` - the path to the folder to store NBM files in.  Will be created if non-existent.  If not set,
uses ``/tmp/nbmserver`` or OS-specific equivalent.
 * ``port`` - the port to run on
 * ``external.port`` - if you are running it behind a reverse proxy such 
as [NginX](http://nginx.org), this sets what port URLs to files this server is 
serving should have - the module catalogue it serves includes download URLs, 
which must be canonicalized.
 * ``password`` - the password used to authenticate the administrator (needed to
add URLs to the system).  If not set, a random one is generated on startup and logged.
 * ``hostname`` - the host name to use in external URLs in the module catalog
 * ``basepath`` - path to prepend to all URLs served and in the module catalog
 * ``workerThreads``, ``backgroundThreads`` - control the size of thread pools used for servicing events and background tasks
    * See note below
 * ``download.threads`` - how many concurrent downloads from remote update/build servers should be attempted simultaneously
    * See note below
 * ``poll.interval.minutes`` - the interval in minutes between checks of remote servers for newer 
versions of the NBMs served.  The default is hourly.
 * ``admin.user.name`` - sets the user name expected for basic authentication for adding modules.  The default is ``admin``.
 * ``log.file`` - the file to log stats and other information to - default is `nbmserver.log` in the process' working directory
 * ``log.level`` - defaults to `info` - see [bunyan-java](https://github.com/timboudreau/bunyan-java) for details

See the documentation for [Acteur](http://github.com/timboudreau/acteur) for 
additional settings.  The properties are loaded using [Giulius](http://github.com/timboudreau/giulius)
and follow its rules for what overrides what.

_Note:_ Since Netty and Acteur are asynchronous, threads are used much more efficiently - a single
thread can simultaneously service hundreds or thousands of connections.

If you use files instead of command-line arguments, the server periodically checks and reloads these.  To guarantee changes are picked up, restart the server (it starts very fast!).


The Generated Update Center Module
----------------------------------

On startup, the server generates a NetBeans module on-the-fly which can be 
installed and will register your server as an update server.  Once a user has
done that, NetBeans will automatically check back with your server for updates.

Some care is taken to ensure the generated module is not updated unless something has
changed, but is if something has:

 * The implementation version is a SHA-1 hash of the sorted keys and values used to generate it
 * The package name and module code name are derived from the server's update catalogue URL, so multiple servers can be hosted on one domain but will generate unique modules
 * The module's specification version incorporates
   * The version of the server
   * A munged timestamp from the first time the server was run
   * A number which is incremented every time the generated bits differ from the preceding run

This does mean you should take some care choosing your host name and base path, as the module will not know if you change them later (a new one will be generated, but the old one will be broken).

The following settings can be set as described above, and affect only the module:

 * ``update.url.https`` - use https for the update URL
 * ``serverDisplayName`` - what the server is called in descriptions (e.g. "Joe Blow's modules")
 * ``module.author`` - the name to show for the module author;  uses ``System.getProperty("user.name")`` if unset


Build and Run
-------------

Build with Maven and run the JAR.  Builds can be downloaded [here](http://timboudreau.com/builds).
_Requires JDK 7 or greater._

The build creates a merged JAR file which contains all of the project's dependencies, called ``nbmserver-standalone.jar`` which is suitable for deployment and can be run with ``java -jar``.


Security & Reverse Proxy Setup
------------------------------

Calls which modify server state use HTTP Basic Authentication and require the
administrator user name and password (see configuration below).

Basic authentication is not secure unless you use HTTPs.  The standard way to
do that is to run the server behind a reverse proxy such as 
[NginX](http://nginx.org).

The following is an example NginX configuration which reverse-proxies the application
and redirects secured requests to HTTPS:

	location	 /modules {
		proxy_set_header	X-Real-IP	$remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header	X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header	X-Forwarded-Host $host;
		proxy_set_header	Host $http_host;
		proxy_pass	http://localhost:8959;
		proxy_redirect	off;
	}
        location        /modules/add {
                if ($scheme = http) {
                        rewrite  ^/(.*)$  https://my.host.name/$1  permanent;
                }
                proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP       $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Host $host;
                proxy_set_header        Host $http_host;
                proxy_buffering         off;
                proxy_pass      http://localhost:8959;
                proxy_redirect  off;
        }

Replace ``my.host.name`` with the actual host name of the server.  To use this
configuration, you would want to start the server with ``--hostname my.host.name``
so that generated URLs will be correct.

Here is an example set of arguments for a [Debian](http://debian.org) launch
script (start from ``/etc/init.d/skeleton``):

```
DAEMON_ARGS="-jar 
    /home/tim/nbmserver-standalone.jar --password somepassword --basepath modules 
    --nbm.dir /var/nbmserver --port 8959 
    --hostname my.host.name --external.port 80 --external.secure.port=443"
```

The salient details of what this does:
 
 * Save and load NBM files using the folder ``/var/nbmserver``
 * Use port 8859
 * Use the hostname ``my.host.name`` in generated URLs in its module catalog
 * Set the ports used in generated URLs (we are behind a reverse proxy, so
we don't want to ask normal users to connet over port 8859)


### Forcing Updates

The URL path `/tickle?token=...` can be used to stop the refresh interval timer,
force an immediate update attempt on all modules being served, and then restart
the timer.  The passed token can either be set on the command-line or in Settings
using the key `tickleToken`, or by default it is set to a random string which is
logged to system out (not the log file, which can be read online) on startup.


Internals
---------

The server stores files in the folder specified by the property/argument ``nbm.dir``.  This is
laid out as follows:

 * nbm.dir
   * first.module.code.name.base
      * nbm-sha1-hash.json - JSON representation of the information in the module's ``Info/info.xml`` file, plus the original URL, download time, etc.
      * nbm-sha1-hash.nbm - the actual nbm file
   * second.module.code.name.base
      * ...

So, each module is stored in a directory with the module's code name as its name.
A version of a module is represented by a JSON file and an NBM file.  The name portion
of each file is the SHA-1 hash of the nbm file's bits.

The version of the module served is the one with the highest specification version in
its manifest.  If there is more than one build of the same version, the most recently
downloaded is used.

``Caveat:`` The above algorithm does mean that if you add url-to-nbm A pointing to
com.foo.mymodule 1.2 and later you add url-to-nbm B pointing to com.foo.mymodule 1.0,
the version served will be 1.2.

The server honors the ``If-Modified-Since`` and ``If-None-Match`` headers to reduce
server load.


Stats
-----

The server logs simple stats as lines of JSON to ``stats.log`` in the folder NBMs are
served from.  The activity can be identified by the combination of property names.

 * ``{"ref"="-", "addr"="/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:51328", "time"="Sun, 14 Jul 2013 06:46:31 GMT"}`` - an index page hit with referrer
 * ``{"id"="abcd", "addr"="/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:51328", "time"="Sun, 14 Jul 2013 06:46:39 GMT"}`` - a
request for the NBM catalog, possibly with an installation ID identifying a unique user
 * ``{"pth"="com.foo.bar/sha1-hash.nbm", "addr"="/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:51288", "time"="Sun, 14 Jul 2013 06:37:29 GMT"}`` - a download of an NBM

Server start and shutdown events are also logged.


To-Dos
------

 * Repack jars using pack200
 * Automatically sign JARs if a certificate is provided
 * More admin UI for configuring some of the settings described above
 * Auto-generate version numbers and repack (and possibly re-sign) NBM bits 
[as described here](http://wiki.netbeans.org/AggregatingUC#Version-aware_push) so that even if the remote bits version didn't change, if the bits did, it increments

Metrics
-------

Logging is done in a format compatible with [bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan). Bunyan is quite
useful for monitoring and filtering logs in real time.

A couple of scripts
are included in the project root directory for analyzing logs to determine the geographic distribution of users.
They require NodeJS, bunyan and geoiplookup to be available on the path.  For a simple geographic distribution,
tweak the uniqueAddresses script to point to your `nbmserver.log` is and run `./uniqueAddresses | ./listaddrs`.
